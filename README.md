Some scripts in Java from the class of Algorithms and Data structures.

* Depth First Search on a Directed Graph. Ties should be resolved using the natural ordering of the elements. The list must contain all the vertices that can be discovered using DFS at the order at which they are discovered.
* Breadth First Search on a Directed Graph. Ties should be resolved using the natural ordering of the elements. The distances arrayholds the path lengths of the vertices from the source vertex. More specifically, the element (distances[i]) holds the shortest path length from the source to i. Additionally, the through array holds the ancestors of the vertices. The element through[i] holds the index of the vertex via which i was explored.
* BipartiteCheck, performs the computation to figure out if Graph is bipartite and compute and store the values isBipartite,bigGroupSize and smallGroupSize. The value bigGroupSize must be equal to the number of vertices in the bigger of the two groups of the bipartite graph, or -1 if  the graph is not bipartite. The value smallGroupSize must be equal to the number of vertices in the smaller of the two groups of the bipartite graph, or -1 if the graph is not bipartite.
* ThreeSort sorts three variables using at most two swaps.
* Cities, computes the minimum cost for libraries to be built around cities in the graph
